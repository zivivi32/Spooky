# Mission Accomplishment Letter from Mayor Grimblepot

**To: Protector Brumble McSpade**

Dear Brumble,

By the gourd gods, you've done it! Harvestville is safe once again, and it's all thanks to you. Those rowdy pumpkins didn’t stand a chance against your Pumpkin Cannon skills and bravery. The village is already celebrating your heroic efforts, and I can’t thank you enough for saving us from an eternity of squashy doom.

Even Hilda Hexberry has promised to be more careful with her spells—though, between you and me, we might need your services again come next Halloween. You know how she is...

But for now, you’ve earned a well-deserved rest. The villagers are preparing a grand feast in your honor at **Gourdknob Plaza**, and there will be no shortage of pumpkin pie (from non-cursed pumpkins, of course). So, take a moment to relax and enjoy the festivities—you’ve earned it, hero.

On behalf of all the quirky villagers of Harvestville, we salute you!

**Forever Grateful,**

**—Mayor Barnaby Grimblepot**

P.S. I saved you a special slice of pie!

P.S. (Again) There might be some issues in the graveyard too. But I believe that can wait.
